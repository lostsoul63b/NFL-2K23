### Why is Team X not in there?
I’ve said this in other posts, but the selection process for teams is incredibly complicated. It’s not as simple as “Top 32!”. There are limitations with things like facemask color, nameplates, shared textures, etc. I’m not saying the 32 teams in the mod will be permanent, but the process for selecting them took a VERY long time and was a blocker for why this wasn’t done a long time ago.

### What about divisions for Franchise?
When you start a franchise, you can customize the league however you like. I have included 2 different Franchise files in Release One and you can always just start a Franchise from inside of the game itself.

### Can I have this and NFL 2K23 installed at the same time?
They can both be downloaded, but not activated at the same time. Thankfully activating and deactivating is as simple as enabling or disabling NCAA23 in GME Utility.

### What about all of the alternate uniforms?
Some combos are included in Release One but let me breathe lol. I’m tired.

### How often will we see roster updates?
I’m not particularly interested in roster creation but I’d welcome any community help with tweaking the base.

### Can we swap teams?
Technically, sure. It’s a ton of work though.

### How does the schedule work?
You’ll see conference games towards the end of the schedule. Also, you never play the same opponent twice.
