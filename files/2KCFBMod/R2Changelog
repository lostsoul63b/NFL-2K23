Release Two is an enormous upgrade and brings a brand new way to play NCAA 2K23.

Introducing Legends, an all-time roster and texture mod for NCAA 2K23 that allows you to switch from playing the 2022 rosters and teams and jump into a legend-packed experience complete with new teams that are full of  your favorite players from the past. 

Want to see VY and Reggie face off again? Or beat Bama with Johnny Football and Mike Evans? Now you can. 

Here are the team changes that are exclusive to the Legends mode:

Build Your Team of Legends
Each team uses an All-Time roster, so you can either play against other legends teams or fantasy draft (which is basically ultimate team).

More Realism
Cyberfaces make their way into the Legends mod and will continue to be added over time. Play by Play is also fixed so over 1,000 players have their names called.

Quality of Life Improvements
This update features over 3,000 additional textures, fixes, etc that create a better quality experience.
